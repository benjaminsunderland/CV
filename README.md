## Benjamin Sunderland

Having had a fascination in software development since a young age, I decided to embark on a software engineering career. This led me to the award winning bootcamp 'Makers Academy'. After graduating, I set up in Munich where I have been for the last one year and seven months. I have been working for a fintech start-up 'Bilendo' who are based in credit management and have an online platform.

As a credit management platform, we had a variety of clients from small to very large. My role has seen me working closely alongside multi billion revenue companies. An example of my work included me building one of our main clients a user role feature which would be able to limit access in our software for certain user-types. Our close relationship with these type of companies included our team building a feature where customers could insure their invoices on our order-to-cash platform. My role was to create the data-transfer feature so we are able to send customer data to the re-insurer.

Currently, I am working at parcelLab. I spend my time connecting to APIs to transform this data that I apply to a model my system uses. parcelLab is a intermediary company that connects shops to their customers. We make sure people get an awesome delivery experience by providing realistic data and a better journey where they will always come back.

## Skills

- Communication & Team Work

I have always enjoyed working in teams and I frequently get feedback that I am a good communicator. Working on complex projects requires the team you are on to communicate effectively. One example of this was working on an 'Hosted Invoice Page'. This page required the user to pay their invoices via various external services such as Stripe or PayPal. During the early development of connecting to these APIs, communication and pair programming was essential as we were using the same version control system to commit the data and make changes. The communication skills that we used at the beginning set the foundations of now a really big feature. This is extremely necessary in the early stages of a product otherwise a huge amount of time and money would be wasted if a wrong direction was taken. This experience really taught me one of the many ways that makes a great developer.

- Adaptability to learning and self reliance

I have always preferred learning by 'doing', and on the job, rather than by being 'taught' which is one reason why I decided not to go to university. I've worked for GRSyndicate developing multiple marketing websites using SEO and front-end languages. There, in a very small team I had to learn on the job to research methods of building better and more effective websites in terms of functionality, maintainibilty and SEO friendly design. As a developer, it is necessary to be self-reliant. This required me to increase my knowledge where to look for an answer on the internet but gave me the ambition to find better solutions to harder problems. A good amount of patience is needed to go through trial/error experience as a developer but the key to overcome this is motivation and ambition. This environment gave me the skills I needed to become the effective 'self-taught' learner I am today.

- Technical Skills

At an early age, I had a fascination in automation software which would play a particular computer game for me. I developed a basic understanding of how java-based scripts are structured as the game I played was programmed in this language. From these early experiences I have continued to have an interest in technology and programming. This has led me to work at a variety of places that required a different skillset where I learned different object orientated programming languages. This digital world ultimately led to me signing up at Makers Academy and learning a variety of object-orientated programming languages. In the last couple of years in my employment, I have been immersed into the world of Rails where I learned:

 * The MVC pattern
 * Associations
 * ActiveRecord
 * Data Life Cycle
 * Unit Testing
 * Integration Testing
 * REST and HTTP protocol
 * API/JSON
 * Maintainibility 
 * PostgreSQL 
 * Git
 * CircleCI
 * HTML5
 * CSS
 * JQuery
 * Tools To Project

 This ultimately has taught me how to structure and build a beautiful application.
